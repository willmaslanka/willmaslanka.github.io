Landscape fires play a significant role in the global carbon cycle, through the combustion of biomass. Space-based Earth Observation is essential for estimating wildfire activity on regional to global scales. Fire emission inventories generally fall into two categories; “bottom-up”, that estimate biomass burned based on observed burned area, Active Fire counts, and/or Fire Radiative Power (FRP), and relying on uncertain parameters such as pre-fire fuel load or combustion completeness, or more direct “top-down” approaches, that relate observed FRP directly to emissions, bypassing the need bottom-up parameters. The Fire Radiative Energy Emission (FREM) approach is a direct top-down methodology that directly links FRP observations with emissions, such as carbon monoxide (CO) or aerosols. Previously, FREM has only been applied using geostationary FRP data from SEVIRI onboard Meteosat Second Generation. This study presents two expansions of the FREM methodology. Firstly, FREM-AU, which applies FREM to Australia using Himawari-9 geostationary FRP data to estimate CO emissions, with a focus on the 2019 “Black Summer” bushfire season. Secondary, FREM-HL, which extends FREM to high latitudes (≥60°N) by using polar-orbiting FRP data from MODIS instead of geostationary FRP data, leveraging orbital convergence to enhance coverage. In both expansions, biome-specific emission coefficients were derived by comparing Fire Radiative Energy (FRE) from identified fires with Total Column CO observations from TROPOMI onboard Sentinel-5P. These coefficients and resulting emission totals were compared with existing top-down and bottom-up inventories. Results demonstrate that FREM offers direct, real-time estimates of fire emissions, reducing reliance on uncertain assumptions inherent to bottom-up methods.
