We detail the progress made to the High Latitude (>60°N) Fire Radiative Energy Emission (FREM) methodology aimed at the direct estimation of smoke, carbon, reactive and greenhouse gas emissions from high latitude wildfires. We focus here on carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, and via application of a CO emissions factor on total carbon emissions. Using approximately 800 individual landscape fires observed jointly with the TROPOMI instrument onboard Sentinel-5P and with VIIRS and MODIS in the 2019 – 2023 period, we have developed a set of "FREM" coefficients linking emission rates of wildfire-emitted CO to rates of fire radiative energy (FREM) release by the fire. These CO emission coefficients have been calculated for four different biome types that exist across  the high latitude region - Deciduous Needleleaf Forests, Evergreen Needleleaf Forests, Grasslands, and Shrublands. The FRE data used to generate these coefficients come from a developmental version of the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS v1.4) that incorporates fire diurnal cycle modelling. Estimates of total wildfire CO emissions have then been calculated for the period 2019 – 2023 based on VIIRS- and MODIS-derived FRE data, and a scaling factor applied to estimate CO emissions over a far longer (2003 – 2023) period when only the publicly available GFAS daily MODIS-derived FRE are provided from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service GFAS v1.2.
