This study looks to apply the "Top-Down" Fire Radiative Energy Emission (FREM) approach on high-latitude fires in Alaska, Northern Canada, and Siberia; to derive biome-specific emission coefficients for Carbon Monoxide. Observations were made of approximately 170 individual fires with both the VIIRS instrument upon the Joint Polar Satellite System, and the TROPOMI instrument upon Sentinel-5P, in the northern hemispheric summer of 2019 and 2020; in order to directly relate polar-orbiting observations of Fire Radiative Power with Excess Carbon Monoxide measurements for high-latitude Deciduous and Coniferous Needleleaf forest fires.
