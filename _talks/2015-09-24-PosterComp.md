Poster presenetation on an update to the preliminary simulation results from the Arctic Snow Microstructure Experiment (ASMEx), undertaken as part of my PhD. In addition, this poster introduced two different snow emission models; the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model, and the Nicrowave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS). This work was presented to undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as to all staff members within the Department of Meterology at the University of Reading.
