Part of the Landwise project, this study seeks to extend and refine routine, in-service catchment-scale mapping of soil moisture, utilizing both space-based and ground-based radar units. The research to date has focused upon building a timeseries of relative soil moisture data for the Thames Basin, (focusing on the Upper Thames, Loddon, and Kennet catchments) in South East England using Sentinel 1 satellite observations.  Through this time series, it is possible to see seasonal changes, impacts of droughts, winter storms, and even individual storm tracks. It also allows for a comparison of soil moisture with respect to different land uses and widescale catchment properties, including land-scale NFM measures such as changes to agricultural practice.

We are working with the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) to help validate the satellite data with ground-bases radar observations, using a purpose built Radar Rig, along with other soil moisture observations. Together with soil properties measured by CEH, the observations from the field studies will be used to refine Landwise modelling predictions of land use change impacts.

Our ultimate aim is that the work will lead towards the development of tools for land managers, including farmers, to help inform land management decisions, not least those around NFM.
