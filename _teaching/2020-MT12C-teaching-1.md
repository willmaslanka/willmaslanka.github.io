## Summary module description:
This module introduces instruments and techniques used to measure meteorological parameters and basic skills in laboratory experimentation, as well as developing skills in computer programming useful in environmental  science.

### Aims
* To introduce the instruments and techniques used to measure meteorological parameters, and to appreciate their limitations;
* To introduce basic skills in laboratory  experimentation;
* To develop skills in computer programming useful in environmental science, for data processing and analysis.

### My Role
* Leading demonstrations and tutorials for undergraduate students, during their formative assessments in the laboratory; which included content on generic characteristics of instruments for environmental measurement, as determined by response, sensitivity, lag, sampling and error analysis. The design, operation and calibration of instruments used to measure temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, broadband solar and terrestrial radiation, rainfall and upper air properties.
* Marking and providing feedback on their formative and summative laboratory based assessments, which involved a short laboratory report.
