## Summary module description:
This module introduces key concepts in atmospheric science, and skills in interpreting meteorological data, and provides an introduction to a wide range of topics in meteorology.

### Aims
This module aims to provide the student with a basic understanding of atmospheric structure and composition and the observational network which is used to monitor atmospheric variables. It aims also to provide knowledge and understanding of global mean seasonal patterns of atmospheric variables and their inter-relationships as well as the basic nature of selected weather disturbances and climate phenomena. Additionally it provides an introduction to the forecasting of atmospheric phenomena. Through the practicals, this module aims to introduce and develop skills in the analysis of meteorological observations. With the individual essay assignment, this module aims to introduce and develop transferable skills in communication (writing, presentation, and referencing) and research (critical analysis).

### My Role
* Leading demonstrations and tutorials for undergraduate students, during their formative assessments; which included content on atmospheric composition and structure, air masses, weather systems and forecasting, synoptic observations and isobaric charts, frontal analysis, weather system analysis, and introductions to climate change and boundary layer meteorology. 
* Marking and providing feedback on their formative assessments
