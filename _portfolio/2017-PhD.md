## PhD Thesis Abstract
Global observations of snow cover and snow water equivalent are vitally important
for climatological and hydrological studies, at both global and local scales. Passive microwave remote sensing techniques have been used over the past 30 years to produce global estimations of snow water equivalent through empirical calculations. However, the uncertainties surrounding the influence of snow microstructure has led to large errors in snow water equivalent estimation.

This study examined the extinction properties of the natural snowpack and produced a new extinction coefficient, for use with the semi-empirical multiple layer Helsinki University of Technology (n-HUT) snow emission model. Snow slabs from the natural snowpackwere extracted and observed radiometrically upon bases of different reflectivities, as part of the Arctic Snow Microstructure Experiment (ASMEx). Snow parameters were characterised via traditional snowpit observation techniques, as well as with modern high resolution methods, such as with the SnowMicroPen and X-Ray Computer Tomography analysis.

The ASMEx snow slab data were used with a flux coefficient model to calculate six flux absorption and scattering coefficients. The six flux scattering coefficients in themvertical polarization were used with a theoretical absorption coefficient model to create a new empirical extinction coefficient, eliminating the need to use subjective observations.

The new extinction coefficient was compared to the original n-HUT extinction coefficient model, through the observation and simulation of snowpack brightness temperatures, obtained as part of the Sodankyl¨a Radiometer Experiment (SoRaX). The derived extinction coefficient produced more accurate simulated brightness temperatures at vertical polarizations, especially at 36.5 GHz. The ability to include snow specific surface area data within the n-HUT model has greatly increased its capability; by increasing the breadth of microstructure parameters to include objective observations of specific surface area, and by increasing the accuracy of simulations of the natural snowpack.

### PhD Fieldwork: The Arctic Snow Microstructre Experiment

To derive a new semiempirical extinction coefficient model, the radiometric and snow characteristic data of the ASMEx [31], [32] were used. The radiometric observations included observations of extracted snow slabs of approximately 80 × 80 × 15 cm2, extracted from naturally accumulated taiga snow, upon two bases with different radiometric properties, a reflective metal plate (a near-perfect reflector, interface reflectivity = 1) and an absorptive blackbody base (a near-perfect absorber, interface reflectivity = 0), similar to those in [33] and [34]. Radiometric observations were made at an incidence angle of 50° to the vertical at 18.7, 21.0, 36.5, 89.0, and 150.0 GHz, at both horizontal polarization (H-Pol) and vertical polarization (V-Pol). The reflective metal plate and the absorptive blackbody base were both allowed to acclimatize to the ambient physical air temperature of the snow, prior to the radiometric observations, to reduce the risk of the snow melting and refreezing to the bases during the observations [32]. Observations of the downwelling sky radiation at all available frequencies and at both polarizations were made immediately after the radiometric observations of the snow slabs, in order to observe any changes in environmental downwelling radiation. Upon the completion of all radiometric observations, the physical properties of the snow (snow temperature, density, thickness, snow crystal size and specific suface area (SSA); Figures X - X) were characterized using the conventional snowpit observation techniques (as described by Leppänen et al. [18]) as well as by X-ray computer tomography (μCT, [29], [30]). This allowed for both conventional and modern observation techniques (in the case of microstructure parameterization, and subjective and objective observation techniques, respectively) to be used. Fig. 1 shows the approximate location of all physical observations made across the ASMEx slabs, as well as the calculated location of the radiometric footprint. Prior to the ASMEx campaign, iterative measurements of a reflective metal sheet upon the absorbing blackbody material were completed, in order to empirically find the dimensions of the radiometer footprint and the effects and positions of the associated sidelobes. The center of the Styrofoam positioner was very sensitive to the metallic strip, while the edges of the Styrofoam were hard/not sensitive to the metallic strip, thus highlighting the location of the footprint. 

This field of view characterization was drawn upon a “Styrofoam positioner” used throughout the ASMEx campaign (see [32, Fig. 3.5]) to allow for numerous snow slabs to be observed from the same location, thus keeping the radiometric footprint within the snow slabs. This could produce a potential source of error, as misalignment of the snow slabs with the positioner markings could result in different parts of the snow slab, or even the plastic support box, being present in the field of view. A second potential source of error is present, due to the fact that the snow slabs were not in the far field of the radiometers, due to the practicalities of the ASMEx campaign; however, determining the impact of this error could not be calculated without careful analysis, which is beyond the scope of this study.

### PhD Presentations and Talks
Across the course of my PhD, I gave a number of poster and oral presentations, detailing the progress of my PhD fieldwork, analysis, and verification of the derived semi-empirical extinction coefficient. These presentations were given to a wide range of audiences, to other PhD students within the Department of Meteorology (found [here](http://willmaslanka.github.io/files/WMaslanka_150924_PosterComp.pdf) and [here](http://willmaslanka.github.io/files/Snow_Obs_150520.pdf)), as well as at international conferences on Snow Microstructure ([MICROSNOW1](http://willmaslanka.github.io/files/MICROSNOW_WM_140723.pdf) and [MICROSNOW2](http://willmaslanka.github.io/files/MicroSnow2_WM_150714.pdf)), as well as an invited speaker to [WSL SLF](http://willmaslanka.github.io/files/Davos_141105.pdf).

### PhD Publications
As part of my PhD, I produced two first-author peer-reviewed publications (found [here](http://willmaslanka.github.io/files/gi-5-85-2016.pdf) and [here](http://willmaslanka.github.io/files/TGRS-57-7405-2019.pdf)), and a PhD thesis ([found here](http://willmaslanka.github.io/files/18000327_Maslanka_Thesis.pdf)).
