This dataset includes relative surface soil moisture across the Thames Valley, between October 2015 and September 2021, using backscatter radar data collected using the ESA Sentinel-1 Constellation. Radar backscatter was normalised to 40 incidence angle, using a novel monthly normalisation parameterisation.
