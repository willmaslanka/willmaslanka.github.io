I am a Research Associate in Earth Observation Sciences, at King's College London, as part of the Earth Observation and Wildfire Research Group within the Department of Geography.

I have previously worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Remote Sensing at the University of Reading, as part of the LANDWISE project; where my focus was on the remote sensing of surface soil moisture, through the use of Sentinel-1 observations, for Natural Flood Management research.
