## PAGE IN DEVELOPMENT


I am a Research Associate in Earth Observation Sciences, at King's College London, as part of the Earth Observation and Wildfire Research Group within the Department of Geography.

I have previously worked as a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Remote Sensing at the University of Reading, as part of the LANDWISE project; where my focus was on the remote sensing of surface soil moisture, through the use of Sentinel-1 observations, for Natural Flood Management research.

I obtained a PhD in Atmospheres, Oceans, and Climate, at the University of Reading, jointed funded by the University of Reading and the Finnish Meteorological Institute. For my PhD, I completed a two field campaigns as part of the Arctic Snow Microstructure Experiment (ASMEx), looking at the radiometric and physical properties of natural snow, and developed a new semi-empirical extinction coefficient, for use with the Helsinki University of Technology multiple layer snow emission model (n-HUT).
